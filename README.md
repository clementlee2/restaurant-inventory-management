# restaurant-inventory-management
This is a tool designed to help restaurants optimize inventory management using a combination of operations management principles, predictive analytics, and applied economics models.

🚨 The Problem
Restaurants waste approximately 85% of unused food, with much of it ending up in landfills rather than being composted or donated. This not only contributes to environmental harm but also increases operational costs.

💡 The Solution
This provides restaurant operators with a data-driven platform to:

    Predict inventory needs based on sales trends, seasonality, and menu data

    Reduce food waste through more accurate demand forecasting

    Improve ordering decisions using EOQ models, safety stock calculations, and perishability-aware algorithms

    Integrate economic insights to assess the cost-benefit tradeoffs of waste, donation, and procurement decisions

🔧 Features
    📊 Demand Forecasting using time series and regression models

    🛒 Inventory Optimization via operations research (EOQ, Newsvendor model, etc.)

    ♻️ Waste Reduction recommendations based on perishability and spoilage rates

    📈 Dashboard for real-time tracking and alerting

🧠 Tech Stack
    Backend: Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL

    Analytics: Pandas, StatsModels, Scikit-learn

    Frontend: React / Tailwind (optional future extension)

    Hosting: Render, Supabase, or GCP (cloud-based deployment)

📍 Roadmap
    ✅ MVP with manual CSV upload and forecasting output

    🔜 POS system integration for live sales syncing

    🔜 Donation/composting impact module

    🔜 Mobile-friendly UI with alert notifications
